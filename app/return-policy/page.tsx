                            Bucksbox E-commerce would endeavour to ship all products together.
                            However, this may not always be possible due to some product
                            characteristics or logistical issues. If you purchase multiple
                            products in single transaction, then all the products would be
                            dispatched to a single shipping address given by you. If you wish to
                            ship products to different addresses, then you should book the
                            orders separately based on the delivery addresses. Products shall be
                            delivered by the Courier Partner at the address given by the
                            customer while making the purchase and Bucksbox E-Commerce shall be
                            not be held responsible in case the address shared was incorrect.
